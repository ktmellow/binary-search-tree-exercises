# Binary Tree In JavaScript 

This assignment will require you to implement a binary tree with the following methods.

`insertIteratively`: inserts a node in the proper location using iteration

`insertRecursively`: inserts a node in the proper location using recursion

`containsIteratively`: checks to see if the tree contains a node iteratively

`containsRecursively`: checks to see if the tree contains a node recursively

`findLowest`: finds the lowest value in the tree

`findHighest`: finds the lowest value in the tree

`breadthFirstSearch`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Breadth First Search (from left to right) - you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Breadth-first)

`DFSPreOrder`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Depth First Search Pre-order - you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first)

`DFSInOrder`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Depth First Search In-order - you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first)

`DFSPostOrder`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Depth First Search Post-order - you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first)

`size `: calculates how many nodes are in the tree (do this without adding a size property to your tree! Use a traversal method to calculate this!)

### Bonus

`remove`: removes a node from a binary tree. Remember that this method must take into account if the node has any children and if the node is a leaf. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TOl3Fv4394) is a great video that explains this process.
